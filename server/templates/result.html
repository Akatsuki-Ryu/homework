            <div class="about-story-wrap"><p class="paragraph">Assuming we wanted to simultaneously monitor the
                connectivity (and latencies) from multiple geographically distributed locations and collect all the data
                to a single report that always reflects the current status across all locations. Describe how the design
                would be different. How would you transfer the data? Security considerations?<br/><br/>====the app that
                I made is a backend service , it can be distributed to servers where we need to send the request from .
                the client in this case , will send a request to all the nodes , to tell them to monitor the target from
                different place . when the nodes are done with monitoring , they can send back the client the result .
                in that case , we will have the connection information from different geo locations . <br/><br/>==== to
                do it in a more secure way . since the connection from the client is always considered unsafe and
                unstable , we could setup a backend management node to talk to all the service nodes (which is the one
                actually making the requests). client make a request to the management node to request scanning .the
                management node will send request to service nodes over the globe. when the management node collect the
                data , it will feed back to the client <br/><br/>====as for the security . the request sent from client
                can be going through TLS, also it can be from an native app , which has lower risk of seeing the source
                code and got reverse engineering, management node can be behind cloud front and load balancer. the
                management node will make requests to the service nodes , it can be a request sent from a customised
                protocol on a customised port . tunnelling the communication between the server nodes can be quite an
                effective way to avoid noise and security problems . but the &quot;last one mile &quot; will be still
                normal http request to get the accurate result. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>‍</p></div>
